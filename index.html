        <h2>3. Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>When you use our App, we use cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage and similar technologies ("Tracking Technologies"). These Tracking Technologies allow us to automatically collect information about you, your device, and your online behavior, in order to enhance your navigation in our App, improve our App's performance, perform analytics, customize your experience and offer you, for example, tailored content and advertisements that better correspond with your interests.</p>

        <h3>3.1 What Types of Tracking Technologies Do We Use?</h3>
        <p>When you use our App, we use the following categories of Tracking Technologies:</p>

        <p><strong>(a) Strictly Necessary Tracking Technologies:</strong> These Tracking Technologies are automatically placed on your device when you access or take certain actions on our App. These Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to navigate around and use the features of our App, such as maintaining your login session and game progress.</p>

        <p><strong>(b) Tracking and Advertising Tracking Technologies:</strong> These Tracking Technologies collect information about your behavior in order to make advertising more relevant to you and to your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The Tracking Technologies remember your activity, and that information is shared with advertising partners. Third-party ad networks utilize Tracking Technologies or similar technologies to deliver ads and monitor the performance of such ads. The collection of information through Tracking Technologies by such third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies and principles, which Kepo Games does not control.</p>

        <p><strong>(c) Functionality Tracking Technologies:</strong> These Tracking Technologies allow our App to remember choices you make (such as your language preference, sound settings) and provide enhanced and personalized features. For example, these Tracking Technologies are used for authentication (to remember when you are logged-in) and support other features of our App.</p>

        <p><strong>(d) Performance Tracking Technologies:</strong> These Tracking Technologies collect information about your activity (for example the duration of your use of our App), including behavioral data and content engagement metrics. These Tracking Technologies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information) to improve our App's performance and user experience.</p>

        <h3>3.2 How to Manage Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>If you are accessing our App through a mobile device, you can withdraw your consent to personalized advertising experience on your device at any time by using your device settings as follows:</p>

        <p><strong>On iOS:</strong> Depending on the applicable iOS version, you may withdraw consent across all apps by either enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting or disabling the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" permission in your iOS device settings. Depending on the applicable iOS version, instead of withdrawing consent on a device-wide basis, you may also have the option of withdrawing consent on a per-app basis by disabling tracking permissions for specific apps that appear under the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting in your iOS device settings (precise directions may differ depending on the applicable iOS version).</p>

        <p><strong>On Android devices:</strong> You may withdraw your consent in the Google Ads settings within your Android settings by enabling the "Opt-out of Ads Personalization" setting (precise directions and the name of the setting may differ depending on the applicable Android versions and device manufacturer).</p>
